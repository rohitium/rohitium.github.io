    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a research scientist with a specialization in biophysics. I enjoy 
        working on projects that intersect natural sciences, machine learning, and 
        software development.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I have more than 10 years of research experience across industry and academia.
        Most recently, I was a Computational Biologist at <a href="https://pivotallifesciences.com/">Pivotal Life Sciences</a>, an 
        early-stage therapeutics-focused biotech Venture Capital (VC) firm. There, I
        was part of the AI and Data Intelligence team, building an internal AI platform
        for due dilligence and NewCo creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I was a Multiscale Modeling Researcher at <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a>, where I developed
        a computational workflow for predicting protein-protein and protein-drug interaction
        kinetics using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">Alphafold</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/openmm/openmm">Molecular Dynamics simulations</a>,
        <a href="https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index_msm.html">Markov State Models</a>, and
        <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/2025/02/16/Smoluchowski-Rate.html">analytical rate theories from statistical mechanics</a>.
        I also collaborated with Discovery Chemistry and PK/PD teams to generate molecular-level insights into portfolio drug candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        I did my postdoc at the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>,
        in the lab of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lk38PP0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Carlos J Bustamante</a>,
        where I worked on interrogating dynamics of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11600">artificially designed proteins</a>
        using <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1116702">optical tweezers experiments</a>.
        I also contributed to an explanation for <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.468716v1">anomalous power spectra of DNA Origami tethers</a>
        in these experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, in the group of 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q2aGki8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dmitrii E Makarov</a>,
        where I contributed to the development of a theory for interpreting dynamics of low-dimensional
        coordinates observed in single-molecule experiments and simulations. Briefly, we tested non-Markovian
        models, such as the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b11137">Generalized Langevin Equation</a>,
        <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07361">Generalized Smoluchowski Equation</a>, and
        <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/147/15/152707/196720/Transition-path-times-reveal-memory-effects-and">Fractional Brownian Motion</a>,
        and found that these models where unable to explain the
        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1201811109">long tails observed in transition path time distributions</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Serendipitously, we found that there is a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008307117">theoretical bound</a>
        on the width of transition path time distributions for <strong>Markovian</strong> models, and this bound is violated by the observed long tails. 
        This implied that the use of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0637">one-dimensional diffusion model</a>
        to interpret dynamics of protein folding in single molecule experiments is unjustified.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am originally from New Delhi, India, and I currently live in the SF Bay Area, CA. I like
        playing tennis and chess, reading philosophy, and going on hikes with my wife and dog.
