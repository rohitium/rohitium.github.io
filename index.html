  <section class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Previous Experience</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Previously, I was a Computational Biologist at <a href="https://pivotallifesciences.com/">Pivotal Life Sciences</a>, an 
        early-stage therapeutics-focused biotech Venture Capital firm. At Pivotal, I
        was part of the AI and Data Intelligence team, building an internal AI platform
        for due dilligence and NewCo creation. My primary contributions were in developing
        an internal biological pathways database and drug target prioritization models.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Pivotal, I was a Multiscale Modeling Researcher at <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a>, where I developed
        a computational workflow for predicting protein-protein and protein-drug interaction
        kinetics using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">Alphafold</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/openmm/openmm">Molecular Dynamics simulations</a>,
        <a href="https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index_msm.html">Markov State Models</a>, and
        <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/2025/02/16/Smoluchowski-Rate.html">analytical rate theories from statistical mechanics</a>.
        I also collaborated with Discovery Chemistry and PK/PD teams to generate molecular-level insights into portfolio drug candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        I did my postdoc at the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>,
        in the lab of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lk38PP0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Carlos J Bustamante</a>,
        where I worked on interrogating dynamics of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11600">artificially designed proteins</a>
        using <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1116702">optical tweezers experiments</a>.
        I also contributed to an explanation for <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.468716v1">anomalous power spectra of DNA Origami tethers</a>
        in these experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, in the group of 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q2aGki8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dmitrii E Makarov</a>,
        where I contributed to the development of a theory for interpreting dynamics of low-dimensional
        coordinates observed in single-molecule experiments and simulations. Briefly, we tested non-Markovian
        models, such as the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b11137">Generalized Langevin Equation</a>,
        <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07361">Generalized Smoluchowski Equation</a>, and
        <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/147/15/152707/196720/Transition-path-times-reveal-memory-effects-and">Fractional Brownian Motion</a>,
        and found that these models where unable to explain the
        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1201811109">long tails observed in transition path time distributions</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Serendipitously, we found that there is a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008307117">theoretical bound</a>
        on the width of transition path time distributions for <strong>Markovian</strong> models, and this bound is violated by the observed long tails. 
        This implied that the use of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0637">one-dimensional diffusion model</a>
        to interpret dynamics of protein folding in single molecule experiments is unjustified.

    <h2 class="section-title">Projects & Interests</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Outside ETHNIC AI, I explore projects at the intersection of natural sciences, machine learning, and software. Recent highlights include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.medresearch.us">MedResearch</a> &mdash; A platform to democratize biomedical research and provide evidence-based answers to serious medical questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/sarepta-fda-2025/">Sarepta FDA 2025 RAG Agent</a> &mdash; Chat with FDA documents, clinical studies, press reports, and SEC filings relevant to the Elevidys issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/target-dili-risk-score/">Drug Target DILI Risk Score</a> &mdash; A tool to predict the risk of drug-induced liver injury.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When I step away from work, you can usually find me on a tennis court, studying chess tactics, reading philosophy, or hiking in the Bay Area with my wife and dog.
