    Hello! Iâ€™m a research scientist with a specialization in biophysics. I enjoy 
    working on projects that intersect natural sciences, machine learning, and 
    software development.

    I have more than 10 years of research experience across industry and academia.
    Most recently, I was a Computational Biologist at [Pivotal Life Sciences](https://pivotallifesciences.com/), an 
    early-stage therapeutics-focused biotech Venture Capital (VC) firm. There, I
    was part of the AI and Data Intelligence team, building an internal AI platform
    for due dilligence and NewCo creation.

    Previously, I was a Multiscale Modeling Researcher at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/), where I developed
    a computational workflow for predicting protein-protein and protein-drug interaction
    kinetics using [Alphafold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2), 
    [Molecular Dynamics simulations](https://github.com/openmm/openmm),
    [Markov State Models](https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index_msm.html), and
    [analytical rate theories from statistical mechanics](https://rohitium.github.io/2025/02/16/Smoluchowski-Rate.html).
    I also collaborated with Discovery Chemistry and PK/PD teams to generate molecular-level insights into portfolio drug candidates.

    I did my postdoc at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/),
    in the lab of [Carlos J Bustamante](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lk38PP0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
    where I worked on interrogating dynamics of [artificially designed proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11600)
    using [optical tweezers experiments](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1116702).
    I also contributed to an explanation for [anomalous power spectra of DNA Origami tethers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.468716v1)
    in these experiments.

    I earned my PhD from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), in the group of 
    [Dmitrii E Makarov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q2aGki8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
    where I contributed to the development of a theory for interpreting dynamics of low-dimensional
    coordinates observed in single-molecule experiments and simulations. Briefly, we tested non-Markovian
    models, such as the [Generalized Langevin Equation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b11137),
    [Generalized Smolchowski Equation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07361), and
    [Fractional Brownian Motion](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/147/15/152707/196720/Transition-path-times-reveal-memory-effects-and),
    and found that these models where unable to explain the
    [long tails observed in transition path time distributions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1201811109). 
    
    Serendipitously, we found that there is a [theoretical bound](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008307117)
    on the width of transition path time distributions for *Markovian* models, and this bound is violated by the observed long tails. 
    This implied that the use of the [one-dimensional diffusion model](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0637)
    to interpret dynamics of protein folding in single molecule experiments is unjustified.

    I am originally from New Delhi, India, and I currently live in the SF Bay Area, CA. I like
    playing tennis and chess, reading philosophy, and going on hikes with my wife and dog.
