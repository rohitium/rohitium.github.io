  <!-- Previous Experience Section -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Previous Experience</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Previously, I was a Computational Biologist at <a href="https://pivotallifesciences.com/">Pivotal Life Sciences</a>, an 
        early-stage therapeutics-focused biotech Venture Capital firm. At Pivotal, I
        was part of the AI and Data Intelligence team, building an internal AI platform
        for due dilligence and NewCo creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Pivotal, I was a Multiscale Modeling Researcher at <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a>, where I developed
        a computational workflow for predicting protein-protein and protein-drug interaction
        kinetics using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">Alphafold</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/openmm/openmm">Molecular Dynamics simulations</a>,
        <a href="https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index_msm.html">Markov State Models</a>, and
        <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/2025/02/16/Smoluchowski-Rate.html">analytical rate theories from statistical mechanics</a>.
        I also collaborated with Discovery Chemistry and PK/PD teams to generate molecular-level insights into portfolio drug candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        I did my postdoc at the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>,
        in the lab of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lk38PP0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Carlos J Bustamante</a>,
        where I worked on interrogating dynamics of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11600">artificially designed proteins</a>
        using <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1116702">optical tweezers experiments</a>.
        I also contributed to an explanation for <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.468716v1">anomalous power spectra of DNA Origami tethers</a>
        in these experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, in the group of 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q2aGki8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dmitrii E Makarov</a>,
        where I contributed to the development of a theory for interpreting dynamics of low-dimensional
        coordinates observed in single-molecule experiments and simulations. Serendipitously, we found that there is a 
        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008307117">theoretical bound</a> on the width of transition path
        time distributions for <strong>Markovian</strong> models, and this bound is violated by the observed long tails. 
        This implied that the use of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0637">one-dimensional diffusion model</a>
        to interpret dynamics of protein folding in single molecule experiments is unjustified.

    <h2 class="section-title">Projects & Interests</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Outside ETHNIC AI and Stanford, I explore projects at the intersection of open source software development and medicine. Recent highlights include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.medresearch.us">MedResearch</a> &mdash; A platform to democratize biomedical research and provide evidence-based answers to serious medical questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/sarepta-fda-2025/">Sarepta FDA 2025 RAG Agent</a> &mdash; Chat with FDA documents, clinical studies, press reports, and SEC filings relevant to the Elevidys issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://rohitium.github.io/target-dili-risk-score/">Drug Target DILI Risk Score</a> &mdash; A tool to predict the risk of drug-induced liver injury.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When I step away from work, you can usually find me on a tennis court, studying chess tactics, reading philosophy, or hiking in the Bay Area with my wife and dog.
