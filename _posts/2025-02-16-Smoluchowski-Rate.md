# A Single Molecule View of Diffusion-Limited Bimolecular Association

The first step of biomolecular communication is the binding of two molecules, e.g., a transcription factor binding to the promoter sequence of the target gene or a drug binding to its target protein. Especially from the drug design point of view, it is useful to optimize the structure of the drug molecule such that this binding process is fast, specific, and robust [^1]. Moreover, the rate of such a binding process, also called the "on"-rate and denoted as \(k_{\text{on}}\), is commonly used to parameterize pathway models for cell signaling cascades [^2]. Such pathway models, in turn, act as cost-effective tools for _in silico_ drug screening and target identification and prioritization [^3].

## The Encounter Complex (EC)

A key concept within the theory of bimolecular association is the notion of the **encounter complex (EC)** [^4][^5], or the set of structural configurations observed when the molecules first "encounter" one another, that may be characterized by non-specific interactions between the two molecules [^6][^7]. Depending on the precise structure, orientation, and conditions of this encounter, the molecules may dissociate again or continue to form stable interactions, e.g., van der Waals, hydrophobic, or electrostatic interactions, with possible conformational rearrangements, and settle into a bound complex (BC).

Given an excess of computational resources, the exact on-rate \(k_{\text{on}}\) can, in principle, be calculated from physics-based numerical sampling methods for any two molecules under any arbitrary reaction conditions. However, in practice, the problem is often broken down into two steps:
1. **Diffusion**: The process that leads to the formation of EC.
2. **Interaction dynamics**: Molecule-specific dynamics that lead to BC from EC.

Step 2 must still, in general, be treated using numerical sampling, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [^8][^9][^10], while step 1 often relies on analytical kinetic rate theories.

## The Smoluchowski Diffusion Rate Equation

More than a century ago, Smoluchowski proposed a theory for the kinetics of colloid-coagulation as a diffusion-controlled process [11]. Since then, his theory has been further extended to include effects of unsuccessful collisions [12], ions [13], rotational diffusion [14], and asymmetric binding modes [15].

According to Smoluchowski theory, the rate at which any two biomolecules encounter each other can be written as:

$$
k_{\text{on}} = 4 \pi D R
\label{eq:1}
$$

where \(D = D_A + D_B\) is the sum of diffusion coefficients of the two molecules and \(R = R_A + R_B\) is the sum of their radii. This result is remarkable for several reasons:

1. The association rate for two diffusing molecules turns out to be (surprisingly?) simply proportional to the total size and diffusivity of the molecules.
2. It provides the speed limit (a soft upper bound) of the bimolecular reaction rate for any two molecules. The actual association rate is likely to be less than this quantity.
3. From a practical viewpoint, this rate equation establishes a direct connection between _physical dynamics_ and _chemical kinetics_ of biomolecules.

This last point can be exemplified by deriving Eq. (\ref{1}) from first-principles. Let us start with the usual derivation of the Smoluchowski rate equation from bulk diffusion [16]. 

We envision the dynamics of the two molecules as _isotropic translational diffusion_ between molecules of A and B. Without losing any generality, we put ourselves in the reference frame of molecule A, such that A is held stationary, while B diffuses until molecules of B encounter molecules of A. This model suggests that the concentration of (unbound) B molecules can be described by Fick’s second law:

$$
∂C(\b{r}, t)/∂t = D∇^2C(\b{r}, t)  
\label{eq:2} 
$$

Where $ D = D_A + D_B $ is again the sum of diffusion coefficients of A and B^1, while $ C(\b{r}, t) $ represents the concentration of B at any spatial location **r**  = (r, 𝜃, ø) and at any time t. Note that, for the purpose of this problem, we are not interested in the dynamics of the association of A and B beyond the encounter complex, or the dynamics of dissociation of A and B. 

When A and B are far apart, the concentration of B is just a constant – the bulk concentration of B in solution, say C(r → ∞, t) = C0. As soon as A and B encounter each other, we assume that they have reached the EC. Thus, we install an absorbing boundary condition at the encounter cross-section, e.g. r = R = RA + RB or the sum of the radii of A and B, such that C(r = R, t) = 0. 

At steady state, the rate of change of C(r, t) or the left hand side of Eq. 2 goes to zero. In other words, the concentration distribution of B becomes constant with respect to time, i.e. C(r, t→∞) → C(r). Thus, Eq. 2 reduces to:
